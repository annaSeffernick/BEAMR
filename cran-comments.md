## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Modified the DESCRIPTION file to remove "in R" at the end of the title.

* Modified the DESCRIPTION file to note a manuscript describing the method will be submitted soon.

* Replaced \dontrun with \donttest for examples that take more than 5s to run.

* Replaced "T" and "F" with "TRUE and "FALSE".
