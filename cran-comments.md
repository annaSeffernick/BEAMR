## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Modified the DESCRIPTION file to remove "in R" at the end of the title.

* Modified the DESCRIPTION file to note a manuscript describing the method will be submitted soon.

* Removed the examples in \dontrun that take more than 5s to run, and kept only the short examples.

* Replaced "T" and "F" with "TRUE and "FALSE". 

* Removed unnecessary print() statements in compute_beam_stats.R and compute_set_pvalues.R

* The print() statements were kept in the plot_* functions as these are meant to print plots to the screen.
